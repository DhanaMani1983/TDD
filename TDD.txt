TDD is software development process of writing test first which would fail and then writing minimum amount of code to pass that test

Task: 

Print Numbers 1 to 100
If divisible by 3 replace with Fizz
If divisble by 5 replace with buzz
If divisible by 3 and 5 then replace with FizzBuzz


After that code can be refatored

1. Create a console app, in the main method create a loop which prints number from 1 to 100
2. Create a class library, which has the business logic, name the class library FizzBuzz.Library and class name FizzBuzz
3. Create a class library called FizzBuzz.Library.Test and Class name as FizzBuzzTest
4. Add reference FizzBuzz.Library to the FizzBuzz.Library.Tests
5. Right click on reference and Nuget Nunit and NUnit adapter which helps to see tests within test explorer
6. To check whether test environment is set properly, write the sample test and run
7. In VS enterprise edition, there is a toggle button on the top click it to run test after every build
8. Lets start with simple example, if number 1 then print number 1
9. Create a test method for above action, using Arrange, Act, Assert
10. Nunit has a functionality to pass in values,
